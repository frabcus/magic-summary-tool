Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?

Unique columns - ones where every key is different, show that as a fact
   Maybe cope with case where just one row appears multiple times (e.g. empty)
Detect type of columns: 
   integer / float - give the range, show a mini histogram
   percentage - guess it is one e.g. inventory.ci in JASL station list
   ids (e.g. twitter id long number) vs. integers that are quantities - cross reference between columns
   free text - make a wordle
   ids (e.g. 12d432a3-feb0-49b1-a107-d20751880764 in last.fm data) vs. human language text (can autodetect?)
   url - pull out domain names and show frequency of them, or if all same pull out path, all same pull out query etc.
   lat/lng - show a Google charts marker map probably
   x/y coordinates, spot them and plot on a square
Look at the table / column names and guess what kind of data it is, e.g. geogaphical, music

Anscombe quartet (Ian)
Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)

Make charts again with "empty" removed - or is that misleading?
Total size of database as its own fact
