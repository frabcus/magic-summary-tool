Write second blog post about it

Show the number of columns as well as rows
Show percentage in tooltip on the column charts
Make pictures in collage show full size when hovering over them
Make chart_redrawers per page
Heuristic to detect Epoch-style dates? (see my Last.fm http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/bci56jy/view/hhct6kq)
detect numbers that are really ids
	glos is an id in JASL station list - can we detect this? http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/ahcf7ma/view/b2ga7ha
	abbrv in Myanmar exports has leading zero and is really an id http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/alwgsvi/view/eflrgna
improve number histograms
    The number charts for twitter followers / status are pretty hard to understand - improve
    rca/share/value in Myanmar exports are too broad a histogram - maybe throw away edges? http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/alwgsvi/view/eflrgna
year in Myanmar exports should perhaps be a date/time? http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/alwgsvi/view/eflrgna
Twitter search data - http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/dhfrsqy/view/bty35ny - lang creates country map, which is wrong

Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?
Deal with larger datasets - more than (say) 100,000 rows should take sample and make that clear

Type-specific fact ideas:
   lat/lng - show a Google charts marker map probably
   foreign keys via ids (e.g. twitter id long number) - cross reference between columns
   urls - use path chunks if domains are too similar
   date/time punchcards https://github.com/jeyb/d3.punchcard
Scatter chart for pairs of numbers, e.g. twitter followers/following
   Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)
   Anscombe quartet (Ian)
Total size (in Gb!) of database as its own fact
