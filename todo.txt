Show blank strings and null better in the tables
Remember last tab on reload

Don't show pie chart if one value dominates too much - how do we detect that?
Show less stuff

Only show 5 things in tables - and have button to show more

Unique columns - ones where every key is different, show that as a fact
Detect type of columns: 
   integer - give the range, show a mini histogram
   ids (e.g. twitter id long number) vs. integers that are quantities - cross reference between columns
   float 
   option
   free text - make a wordle
   ids (e.g. 12d432a3-feb0-49b1-a107-d20751880764 in last.fm data) vs. human language text (can autodetect?)
   url - pull out domain names and show frequency of them, or if all same pull out path, all same pull out query etc.
   images - highlight the most common image, or do a little mosaic of random images
   date/time - show density map, or in JASL station list show just limited number
   lat/lng - show a statically generated basic map of the area covered with some shading? country boundary maps?
   percentage - guess it is e.g. inventory.ci in JASL station list
   country codes / names - detect them and show flags magically or show chloropleth map (there is Google API to draw it)
   x/y coordinates, spot them and plot on a square
Look at the table / column names and guess what kind of data it is, e.g. geogaphical, music
