Make chart_redrawers per page

10,100 is a bogus range on the wordle - see my followers vs. rob's

Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?
Pocket info page - there is only one row, so show all the info better somehow
Show percentage in tooltip on the area charts

Detect type of columns: 
   ids (e.g. twitter id long number) vs. integers that are quantities - cross reference between columns
   url - if domains all same pull out path, all same pull out query etc.
   lat/lng - show a Google charts marker map probably
   x/y coordinates, spot them and plot on a square
Look at the table / column names and guess what kind of data it is, e.g. geogaphical, music
Date/time punchcards https://github.com/jeyb/d3.punchcard

Anscombe quartet (Ian)
Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)
Scatter chart for pairs of numbers?

Make charts again with "empty" removed - or is that misleading?
Total size of database as its own fact
