Write second blog post about it

Show percentage in tooltip on the area charts
Make chart_redrawers per page
The number charts for twitter followers / status are pretty hard to understand - improve
Heuristic to detect Unix dates? (see my Last.fm http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/bci56jy/view/hhct6kq)
Make pictures in collage show full size when hovering over them

Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?

Type specific ideas
   lat/lng - show a Google charts marker map probably
   foreign keys via ids (e.g. twitter id long number) - cross reference between columns
   domains - pull out path if too many similar, all same pull out query...
   date/time punchcards https://github.com/jeyb/d3.punchcard
Scatter chart for pairs of numbers, e.g. twitter followers/following
   Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)
   Anscombe quartet (Ian)

Deal with larger datasets - more than (say) 100,000 rows should take sample and make that clear
Total size (in Gb!) of database as its own fact
