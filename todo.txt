Write second blog post about it

Remember last tab on reload

Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?
Pocket info page - there is only one row, so show all the info better somehow

Unique columns - ones where every key is different, show that as a fact
Detect type of columns: 
   integer / float - give the range, show a mini histogram
   percentage - guess it is one e.g. inventory.ci in JASL station list
   ids (e.g. twitter id long number) vs. integers that are quantities - cross reference between columns
   free text - make a wordle
   ids (e.g. 12d432a3-feb0-49b1-a107-d20751880764 in last.fm data) vs. human language text (can autodetect?)
   url - pull out domain names and show frequency of them, or if all same pull out path, all same pull out query etc.
   lat/lng - show a Google charts marker map probably
   x/y coordinates, spot them and plot on a square
Look at the table / column names and guess what kind of data it is, e.g. geogaphical, music
Date/time punchcards https://github.com/jeyb/d3.punchcard

Anscombe quartet (Ian)
Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)

Make charts again with "empty" removed - or is that misleading?
Total size of database as its own fact
