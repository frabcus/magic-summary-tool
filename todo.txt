Write second blog post about it

Show percentage in tooltip on the column charts
Make chart_redrawers per page
The number charts for twitter followers / status are pretty hard to understand - improve
Heuristic to detect Epoch-style dates? (see my Last.fm http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/bci56jy/view/hhct6kq)
Make pictures in collage show full size when hovering over them
detect numbers that are really ids
	glos is an id in JASL station list - can we detect this? http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/ahcf7ma/view/b2ga7ha
	abbrv in Myanmar exports has leading zero and is really an id http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/alwgsvi/view/eflrgna
Show the number of columns as well as rows
year in Myanmar exports should perhaps be a data/time? http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/alwgsvi/view/eflrgna
rca/share/value in Myanmar exports are too broad a histogram - maybe throw away edges? http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/alwgsvi/view/eflrgna
Twitter search data - http://x.scraperwiki.com/dataset/dhfrsqy/view/bty35ny - lang creates country map, which is wrong

Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?
Deal with larger datasets - more than (say) 100,000 rows should take sample and make that clear

Type-specific fact ideas:
   lat/lng - show a Google charts marker map probably
   foreign keys via ids (e.g. twitter id long number) - cross reference between columns
   urls - use path chunks if domains are too similar
   date/time punchcards https://github.com/jeyb/d3.punchcard
Scatter chart for pairs of numbers, e.g. twitter followers/following
   Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)
   Anscombe quartet (Ian)
Total size (in Gb!) of database as its own fact
