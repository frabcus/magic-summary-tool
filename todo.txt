Show less stuff - it's a bit cluttered
Make the order consistent somehow - what should be at the top of the page?

Unique columns - ones where every key is different, show that as a fact
Detect type of columns: 
   integer - give the range, show a mini histogram
   ids (e.g. twitter id long number) vs. integers that are quantities - cross reference between columns
   float 
   option
   free text - make a wordle
   ids (e.g. 12d432a3-feb0-49b1-a107-d20751880764 in last.fm data) vs. human language text (can autodetect?)
   url - pull out domain names and show frequency of them, or if all same pull out path, all same pull out query etc.
   images - highlight the most common image, or do a little mosaic of random images
   date/time - show density map, or in JASL station list show just limited number
   lat/lng - show a statically generated basic map of the area covered with some shading? country boundary maps?
   percentage - guess it is e.g. inventory.ci in JASL station list
   country codes / names - detect them and show flags magically or show chloropleth map (there is Google API to draw it)
   x/y coordinates, spot them and plot on a square
Look at the table / column names and guess what kind of data it is, e.g. geogaphical, music

Anscombe quartet (Ian)
Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)

Make charts again with "empty" removed - or is that misleading?
Total size of database as its own fact
