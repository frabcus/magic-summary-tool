Write blog post about it

Change it to generate "fact" boxes with a score weighting and show the top ones / top one per column (scroll for more facts!)

Let you click the ... to show more (Zarino)
Show total number of rows (Ian) e.g. in comparison to total.
Maybe show % (Zarino)
Show blank strings and null the same somehow?
picture_url in my linked in Jerry data - there are 4 blank rows, rest are
     all different. Special case only one row having > 1? Show fact that all rows have value 1?

Total number of rows as its own fact
Total size of database as its own fact
Pie charts of small group data http://blog.stephenboak.com/2011/08/07/easy-as-a-pie.html
Histogram bar chart of data when larger groups, esp. ones with an order
Detect type of columns: 
   integer - give the range, show a mini histogram
   ids (e.g. twitter id long number) vs. integers that are quantities - cross reference between columns
   float 
   option
   free text - make a wordle
   ids (e.g. 12d432a3-feb0-49b1-a107-d20751880764 in last.fm data) vs. human language text (can autodetect?)
   url - pull out domain names and show frequency of them, or if all same pull out path, all same pull out query etc.
   images - highlight the most common image, or do a little mosaic of random images
   date/time - show density map, or in JASL station list show just limited number
   lat/lng - show a statically generated basic map of the area covered with some shading? country boundary maps?
   percentage - guess it is e.g. inventory.ci in JASL station list
   country codes / names - detect them and show flags magically
   x/y coordinates, spot them and plot on a square
Unique columns - ones where every key is different, show that as a fact
Improve look of fact which shows every key is the same
Look at the table / column names and guess what kind of data it is, e.g. geogaphical, music

Regression correlation between every pair of columns (what Zarino does on Stata)
